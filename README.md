# ChatGPT Solutions

This repository contains multiple implementations that interact with the OpenAI API. Each implementation lives in its own folder.

- `NetBeans/` – NetBeans plugin (v2.0) providing a GUI for ChatGPT.
- `go-cli/` – A command line interface written in Go.
- `flutter-gui/` – A minimal Flutter application providing a GUI interface.
- `dart-cli/` – A command line interface written in Dart.
- `rust-cli/` – A command line interface written in Rust.

All CLI implementations share the same workflow: start an interactive `chat` session, inspect `history`, or `clear` the stored conversation. Each subfolder may provide additional documentation.
