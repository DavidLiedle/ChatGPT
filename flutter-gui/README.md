# Flutter GUI for ChatGPT

This directory contains a simple Flutter application that communicates with the OpenAI API. It mirrors the functionality of the Go CLI by allowing users to send prompts and store responses locally.

The application is intentionally minimal and does not include generated files from `flutter create`. Run `flutter pub get` after cloning and open the project in your Flutter environment.
