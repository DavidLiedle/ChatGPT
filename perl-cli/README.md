# perl-cli

A simple command line tool written in Perl for chatting with ChatGPT. It follows the same workflow as the other CLI examples and stores your conversation history locally. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` before running.

## Usage

# start an interactive conversation
perl perl_cli.pl chat

# show saved history
perl perl_cli.pl history

# clear saved history
perl perl_cli.pl clear
```
